While developing this application, I've learned a number of new skills in terms of React-Native application: routing, scrolling, fetching data, handling user's presses, data loading and refreshing.

## Libraries used
While building this application, I've used a number of additional libraries such as:
+ **react-native** *(mobile development via React)*
+ **axios** *(more efficient way of fetching data)*
+ **expo** *(debugging on a local mobile device)*
+ **react-navigation**, **react-navigation** *(routing)*
